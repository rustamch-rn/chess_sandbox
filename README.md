<li><h4>What will the application do?</h4>
<p>Chess is a game that has existed for centuries and recently has gained a lot of popularity. In my opinion, chess is the ultimate game that can elicit a range of emotions in its player: from desperation when you realize that you made a one-move blunder to great joy when you see a pattern that your opponent cannot escape and which will allow you to win the game. With this project, I will try to recreate chess with all its intricate rules, and after that, I will try to implement some features that will make chess more visually pleasing.</p></li>
<li><h4>Who will use it? </h4>
<p>This application is aimed to give chess enthusiasts and novices a place to explore different chess openings and enjoy the game with their friends.</p></li>
<li><h4>Why is this project of interest to you? </h4>
<p>The previous year, I rediscovered chess for myself and found it exciting to play. Also, I find chess programming interesting, and the idea that humans with everyday come closer and closer to solving this ancient game excites me. So this project would allow me to play with different sets of rules and practice abstraction in the short term, and in the long term, this project will provide a foundation for implementing chess programming techniques and creating my chess engine.</p></li>
