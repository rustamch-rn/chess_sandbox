<h1>Chess Variation explorer</h1>
<ol>
<li><h4>What will the application do? </h4>
<p>Chess is a game that has existed for centuries and recently has gained a lot of popularity. In my opinion, chess is the ultimate game that can elicit a range of emotions in its player, from desperation when you realize that you made a one-move blunder to great joy when you see a pattern that your opponent cannot escape and which will allow you to win the game. Despite that, chess, especially amongst top-ranking players, has become staler and staler since advancement in computing has allowed players to derive and memorize the best moves in positions, which has dramatically increased the number of indecisive games. To solve this issue, solutions that make chess more dynamic and mix up standard positions were proposed. This application will allow its user to explore different variations and mix different sets of rules to create new chess variations.</p></li>
<li><h4>Who will use it? </h4>
<p>This application is aimed to give chess enthusiasts and beginners a place to explore different chess variations, create new ones and have fun playing them with their friends.</p></li>
<li><h4>Why is this project of interest to you? </h4>
<p>The previous year I rediscovered chess for myself and found it really exciting to play. However, as mentioned earlier, chess can become rather repetitive when players blitz out the first 20 moves of the game in a matter of seconds since they know the theory behind these moves. While platforms like chess.com provide an opportunity to play some of the variations that were created throughout the last century, they do not allow users to mix different sets of rules and try them out with their friends. So this project would allow me to play with different sets of rules in the short term, and in the long term, this project will provide a foundation for implementing chess programming techniques and creating my own chess engine.</p></li>
